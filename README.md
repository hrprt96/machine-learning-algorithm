# 1. Classification of text documents using sparse features
  This is an example showing how scikit-learn can be used to classify documents by topics using a bag-of-words approach. This example uses a scipy.sparse matrix to store the features and demonstrates various classifiers that can efficiently handle sparse matrices.The dataset used in this example is the 20 newsgroups dataset. It will be automatically downloaded, then cached.
# 2. Face completion with a multi-output estimators
This example shows the use of multi-output estimator to complete images. The goal is to predict the lower half of a face given its upper half.
